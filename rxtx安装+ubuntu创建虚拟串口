安装 rxtx library :
1.
    sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
    sudo cp /usr/lib/jni/librxtxSerial.so /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_05/jre/lib/amd64/
    sudo cp /usr/lib/jni/librxtxParallel.so /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_05/jre/lib/amd64/
    add /usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar to project Java build path

2.提供串口操作权限
    sudo chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS*

Quota from INSTALL file of rxtx download package:
A person is added to group lock or uucp by editing /etc/groups. Distributions have various tools but this works: `lock:x:54:` becomes: `lock:x:53:jarvi,taj`. Now jarvi and taj are in group lock. Also make sure jarvi and taj have read and write permissions on the port.

3.To create a virtual serial port/device:
terminal -> 
(1) $ socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
output example:

    socat[27201] N PTY is /dev/pts/18

    socat[27201] N PTY is /dev/pts/26

(2) $ sudo ln -s /dev/pts/18 /dev/ttyS99
ps: (/dev/ttyS99 is the virtual serial port)

(3) $ cat < /dev/pts/18
ps: (This will print the content written into /dev/ttyS99)
